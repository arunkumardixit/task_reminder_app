Task Reminder App

## How to set up and run the application.
  ##Android
    * Open Project in Android Studio
    * In Terminal , do Flutter pug get
    * Run Application


## Platform-specific implementations and challenges faced
  ##Android
    For Method Channel Communication , I have used Pigeon package for flutter, which creates interfaces for each of the platforms.
    Created NativeWrapper **TaskTestModuleNativeAPI** around these interfaces to setup flutter engine on MainActivity 
    For Notifications, had to first add alarm with time set in calendar and broadcast the intent with the details of notification.
    Initially tried to push Notification object in the PendingIntent , but on Notifying with NotificationManager on Receive of alarm schedule in broadcastreceiver, it didnt work, so had to push the task details such as title , description in pendingIntent and create Notification on alarm receive event itself.

  ##iOS 
    Similar to android had to add Wrapper **TaskTestModuleNativeAPI** around the native interface generated by pigeon and register it in the AppDelegates did FinishLaunchingwith options.

**Other**
* For storing the tasks in persistent storage , have used RealmStorage
* For Flutter to native communication, used Pigeon package of flutter. 
* For State Management , used Bloc

* 
#**Known Issues/ Functionalities not working**
  * Edit Tasks and notifications
  * Cancel/Delete Tasks and Notifications
